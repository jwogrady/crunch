## Deployment Options

### Railway Single Service ‚≠ê (Recommended)

**Best for:** Production deployment with full Bun backend

Deploy both frontend and backend on Railway in a single service.

**See:** [RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md](./RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md) for complete guide.

**Quick Steps:**
1. `npm install -g @railway/cli`
2. `railway login`
3. `railway init`
4. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
5. `railway up`

## Configuration

### Railway Settings

Railway auto-detects Bun and configures:
- Build command: `bun install && bun run build`
- Start command: `bun run src/server.ts`
- Automatic static file serving from `src/web/dist`

### Build Script

The build script in `package.json`:
```json
"build": "bunx vite build"
```

This builds the frontend React app for production.
